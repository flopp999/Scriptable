# Scriptable

I have some example codes to create different widget.
I have learned this just by copy/paste from other scriptable code.

[Lock Screen 1, no blur background](https://github.com/flopp999/Scriptable/blob/main/js/LockScreen1.js)
<img width=50 height=50 src=/images/LockScreen1.jpg>

[Lock Screen 2, with blur background](https://github.com/flopp999/Scriptable/blob/main/js/LockScreen2.js)
<img width=50 height=50 src=/images/LockScreen2.jpg>

[Lock Screen 3, with blur background and a gap in cricle](https://github.com/flopp999/Scriptable/blob/main/js/LockScreen3.js)

```python python

```
